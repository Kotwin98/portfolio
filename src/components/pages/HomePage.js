          My name is Mateusz Kotwi≈Ñski.
          About 18 months ago I planned to become a Front-end Developer.
          I finished an intense 9 month long bootcamp with
          help of an expirianced teacher - Bootcamp Web Developer Plus in Kodilla.
          I also finished a few interesting courses on Udemy and I had spend a lot of time studying on my own.
          Im still improving my skills, especially in JavaScript and React.
          I have a lot of projects to show my knowledge.
          Currently Im looking for my first job in IT.
