        My name is Mateusz Kotwi≈Ñski.
        About 1,5 years ago I planned to become a Front-end Developer.
        I finished an intense 9 month long bootcamp with
        help of an expirianced teacher - Bootcamp Web Developer Plus in Kodilla.
        I also finished a few interesting courses on Udemy and I had spend a lot of time studying on my own.
        Im still improving my skills, especially in JavaScript and React.
        I have a lot of projects to show my knowledge.
        Currently Im looking for my first job in IT.
